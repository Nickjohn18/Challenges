                                Challenge #1

In this challenge I was asked to meet certain criteria to code the webpage that follows accessibility standards and optimized for search engines. In this challengem, I cleaned up some of the CSS codes, mostly grouped different elements that had the same values. I was also tasked to make sure that all the links and href are link to somewhere and it is actually functional. Chane some of the HTML element to follow and semantic HTML styling.
